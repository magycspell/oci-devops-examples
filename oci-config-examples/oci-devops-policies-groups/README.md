Sample illustrations of `dynamic groups` and `policies` requirements for `OCI Devops` and few connected OCI services.

----------

### ‚ùó Attention please:

- All these samples are written with a sample dynamic groups,please change accordingly. 
- All the policies are using verbs * manage or use * which are powerfull , you may alter with other verbs( read,inspect) as accordingly.
- Use the [References](https://github.com/RahulMR42/oci-devops-policies-groups#references) section to read more about fine grain controls. 


* Specific instruction to clone only this example.

    ```
    $ git init oci-devops-policies-groups
    $ cd oci-devops-policies-groups
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-devops-examples
    $ git config core.sparsecheckout true

### ‚úîÔ∏è User Groups

<details>
<summary>Devops Pipeline (OCI Repo + Build + Deploy) - Click to expand</summary>

-  Create  relevenat users and all the devops users to the user group (One group is minimum).
-  You may use `Administrator` group for devops ,however better to create a specific user group to have better control.
- For further controls ,you may create different user groups like `devops-admins`,`devops-users`,`devops-validators` etc.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Dynamic Groups 

<details>
<summary>Devops Pipeline (OCI Repo + Build + Deploy) - Click to expand</summary>

- Create dynamic group (EG: dg-compartmentname-buildpipeline)for your build pipeline with below rule.

```
ALL {resource.type = 'devopsbuildpipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'compartmentOCID'}

```
- Create dynamic group (EG: dg-compartmentname-deploymentpipeline)for your deployment pipeline with below rule.

```
All {resource.type = 'devopsdeploypipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'compartmentOCID'}
```

- Create dynamic group (Ef: dg-compartmentname-coderepo) for your coderepo with below rule.

```
ALL {resource.type = 'devopsrepository', resource.compartment.id = 'compartmentOCID'}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Devops deployment pipeline with OCI instances - Click to expand</summary>

- Create a dynamic group (Eg: dg-compartmentname-computeinstances) to group all the instances with below rule.

```
All {instance.compartment.id = 'compartmentOCID'}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Devops Connection - For external code repos (Github,Gitlab etc) - Click to expand</summary>

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Use OCI functions with other OCI services (like use vault from functions etc) - Click to expand</summary>

- Create a dynamic group (Eg: dg-compartmentname-functions) to group all the instances with below rule.

```
resource.type = 'fnfunc'
resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..xx'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Use OCI Gateway  with other OCI services (Functions etc) - Click to expand</summary>

- Create a dynamic group (Eg: dg-compartmentname-gateways) to group all the gateways with below rule.

```
